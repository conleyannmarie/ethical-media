## What does Ethical Media do?

The very reasonable and ethical social media helps people rate other people so that a person can know what other people are thinking about them. A user can login, create a profile, be rated, and rate others. A user can rate anyone on any category. A user will first select a person to rate, create a category and then rate the person on that category.

We used Javascript, CSS, HTML, Handlebars, Node.js, Dicebear api, and Express.js to create this project

## Motivation

This was a project done for school. When we teamed up, we wanted to create something that was unique, entertaining, and unlike the other project ideas that our fellow classmates came up with. We eventually decided on creating Ethical-Media! 

## What we learned

We learned many things while building this app. Once thing we learned was to set up github differently, so that when a programmer pushes, it has to get approved. This way we can be more organized with our branches, etc. We also learned to get our MVP pushed to apps like Heroku sooner.

## Installation
This application makes use of MYSQL2 and a few node packages. Be sure to add a .env file and fill out your MYSQL credentials as well as run a npm install to download the appropriate packages.
